/* I ran through heavy testing and debugging for the functions that checked the rows, columns and diagonals for 4 in a row of either X or O. I ran through similar steps of scenarios for all three. I tested each one for the X condition and the O condition, and I checked that each individual row/column/diagonal was checking correctly. I also heavily tested the user_move function to ensure that the moves were properly alternating between player X and O's turns. The main problem was figuring out how to check the multi-dimensional array for the location entered by the user, a number from 1 to 16. At first I tried to test it by running through the entire array and check for the number, but I found that a more efficient way was to use mathematical formulas so that the program wouldn't have to loop through the array. To test if the location corresponding to the user input was being selected by the program, I used a cout statement that printed the (x, y) coordinates of the number that the user inputed (cout << "(" << row << "," << column << ")" << endl;). For example, if the user entered 1, it would output (0, 0). */
